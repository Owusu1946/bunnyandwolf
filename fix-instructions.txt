The structure issue in ProductDetailsPage.jsx is around line 1360.

To fix the issue:

1. Check the JSX element nesting structure in the Reviews section (activeTab === 'reviews')
2. Make sure the proper closing tags are in the right order
3. Ensure all JSX is properly balanced

The problematic area is around these lines:
```jsx
              )}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
```

The correct structure should be:
```jsx
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
```

Since the error is "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag", there's likely a missing fragment or enclosing tag in this area.

Steps to fix:
1. Find this closing structure in the file
2. Re-check the nesting of divs in the reviews section
3. Make sure all JSX elements are properly closed in the right order
4. Check for any extra or missing closing div tags
